Job Description/Responsibilities SEO is an extremely crucial aspect of our online business. As an SEO specialist, your primary role will be to maximize the volume of inbound organic traffic from search engines to our websites. You will manage all on-page and off-page SEO activities to increase rankings on all major search engines (Google, Yahoo!, and Bing) and maximize return on investment (ROI). These activities include, but are not limited to, keyword strategy, content strategy, and link building. For instance, on content strategy, you will be responsible for making key SEO decisions related to website content (e.g., what content the business needs and the webpage on which to upload the content). You must then write the content or delegate this task to freelance content writers. During the development of a new site, you will work with relevant individuals, such as software analysts/architects and developers, to ensure that the website has great, SEO-friendly content. Because search engine algorithms are updated several times every year, an SEO specialist's work environment is very dynamic. This dynamism calls for constant learning, dumping old techniques, adopting new ones, and experimenting with different strategies to perfect one's skills and discover how the industry is changing. The SEO industry has a minimal set of rules, standards, and best practices. Lots of old tricks and misconceptions abound in the industry. Furthermore, there are no schools that teach SEO. Thus, success in the SEO field depends on thorough research, experimentation (trial and error), observation, and experience. As such, we will NOT offer any SEO training. We are looking for an expert: an individual who has already been successful in this field. We are NOT looking for someone we will tell what to do; rather, we are interested in an individual who will advise us on what we need to do AND do it within a specified budget. Education and Skills A diploma or degree in any field. A BS degree in a quantitative, test-driven field is an added advantage. Proven SEO experience. Proven success in link-building and viral strategies. Proven success and experience in building inbound organic search traffic and improving site rankings on search engine results pages (SERPs). Up-to-date working knowledge of past, current, and projected trends in the SEO industry. Familiarity with the best tools in the trade. A background in creating reports showing web analytics data and site evaluations. Functional understanding of web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Knowledge of PHP is an added advantage. Must have a strong online presence and a passion for the web. Excellent online research skills. Proactive and self-motivated. A fast learner. Willingness and the ability to research, learn, and apply new ideas quickly are very important traits. Good written grammar skills. Availability of Position Immediate. How to Apply If you are interested in this position, please send your CV and cover letter to careers@sharkswebservices.com by Thursday, August 31, 2023, at 5:00 PM East Afrikan Time (EAT).

In disaster, in hardship, in more than 40 countries around the world, we partner to put bold solutions into action \u2014 helping people triumph over adversity and build stronger communities from within. Now, and for the future.Mercy Corps began working in Kenya in 2008 and has to date built a robust and diverse portfolio of programs aimed at sustainably improving the lives and livelihoods of Kenyans affected by poverty, resource scarcity and conflict. To do this, we deliver integrated programming to strengthen resilience, market and governance systems, address the root causes of conflict, and equip vulnerable populations- in particular youth, women, adolescents and marginalized social groups- with the skills, opportunities and resources they need to be healthy, productive, and drive the development of their communities. Mercy Corps Kenya also collaborates with Mercy Corps teams and partners in neighboring countries to implement a number of multi-country and cross-border programs.Purpose / Project Description:Mercy Corps and its consortium partners are implementing a five-year USAID/Bureau of Humanitarian Assistance (BHA)-funded program entitled USAID Nawiri in Turkana and Samburu Counties of Kenya focused on nutrition resilience. The program aims to sustainably reduce persistent acute malnutrition in the two counties over a five-year period using a multi-sectoral program approach that integrates resilient livelihoods, access to improved water, health and sanitation services, and strengthening enabling systems for nutrition from household to national level. USAID Nawiri dedicated the first two years (Phase 1) to implementing an action research agenda to inform the program design to achieve the program's goal in the remaining three years (Phase 2). The program is currently embarking on an ambitious implementation plan to layer and integrate a series of interventions that address both immediate and systemic drivers of acute malnutrition, while addressing the effects of extreme drought and the global food crisis in implementation areas. Throughout all stages, the program is working closely with government, community, and private sector partners.USAID Nawiri's implementation started in the midst of one of the most severe drought crises in 40 years, causing catastrophic humanitarian needs in the Horn of Africa. The program is implementing an emergency response (Drought Emergency Response - DER) that includes cash transfers to ultra-poor households in Turkana and Samburu Counties. At the same time, the program is launching activities designed to support and strengthen resilient livelihood systems and sustainable livelihood pathways. A resilient livelihood draft strategy was designed based on research and analysis including Household Economic analysis (HEA), Cost Of Diet (COD) Study and other food and labor markets studies. These highlighted how livelihood strategies not only need to be specifically tailored to livelihood zones and contexts but need to be intentional about how they contribute to nutrition outcomes beyond increased income, production and general market systems strengthening. They need to consider social behavioral change strategies that increase willingness and ability to pay for nutritious diets and associated nutrition services (water/health/education/natural resources), and ensure production, income strengthening, livelihood diversification and market connections. Resilient Livelihoods interventions must then support households to maintain a sufficient level of cash flow achieved with the cash transfers in this emergency phase that stimulates demand for nutritious food items and associated commodities, and that the market continues to be able to respond with sufficient supply. The program is recruiting a consultant for 3 months, with possible extension if needed, to work with the Resilient Livelihoods teams to assess and refine a coherent strategy for supporting and strengthening resilient livelihood systems and sustainable livelihoods pathways that contribute to sustainable reductions in persistent acute malnutrition and broader goals of nutrition security. This strategy must be informed by evidence and learning, tailored to context, and translated into a detailed implementation plan, inclusive of results chains, population segmentation and detailed targeting plan. It should also inform a learning agenda to frame and focus adaptive learning. This person will ensure that the strategy and resulting plan are grounded in principles and practices of poverty economics (including graduation) and market systems development that address the economic feasibility, value for money, and sustainability of different livelihood approaches to shocks and stresses. S/he should have excellent knowledge of macro and micro-economics, market systems applied to agriculture and food and how to strengthen them in arid land contexts. In close collaboration with the Chief of Party (CoP), the Technical Director, the Strategic Learning Lead, the Nutrition Resilience Advisor, the DER Coordinator, the Climate Smart Agriculture Advisor and the Alternative Livelihoods & Market Advisor, and in communication with the Monitoring & Evaluation Lead, the Poverty Economics & Market System Senior Specialist will facilitate the review and ground testing of a robust Resilient Livelihoods for Nutrition Security strategy. A key focus of the role will be to support the project's team members in understanding, applying, and assessing market-based approaches that are sustainable, build livelihoods and directly contribute to nutrition security. S/he will guide, and mentor program leads and staff to strategize and apply poverty economics and systems thinking to diagnose challenges and opportunities for supporting and strengthening livelihood systems to deliver sustainable results for nutrition security at scale. Consultant Activities:The SCC Senior Resilience Curriculum Consultant will:PROGRAM APPROACH DESIGN AND STRATEGY (75% of consultancy efforts)Facilitate the team to review and own USAID Nawiri's operational definition for Resilient Livelihoods\" and related conceptual framework that articulates the relationship between resilient livelihoods and nutrition security. Use those as tools to facilitate joint planning and decision-making across USAID Nawiri sectors and disciplines. Review market systems, labor market, household economy diagnostics and other research conducted during Phase 1 of the program and support the team to assess current implementation progress including relevance, effectiveness of interventions, efficiency of implementation strategies and sustainability of interventions based on prevailing economic, social, environmental and political conditions. Based on the Niaseku diagram\"--a program diagram that utilizes the socio-ecological framework for behavior change to illustrate the multi-dimensional package of assets and services an individual and her household require for nutrition security-- facilitate team thinking and joint planning processes on capacities households and communities need to develop resilient livelihoods and draw linkages with market actions to be undertaken by the program. This will lead to designing the strategy with its package of interventions for households and Wards.Use analysis to provide comprehensive recommendations and set the vision for systemic change within selected market and labor sectors that will contribute to household nutrition outcomes. This vision and its translation into a written Resilient Livelihoods strategy and implementation plans must ensure continuity between life-saving short-term interventions and longer-term resilience building interventions. The strategy will also include a scaling plan for the interventions.Support the team in developing zone-based work plans with packages of interventions relevant to households needs. Support intervention leads in defining partnership strategies (internal, with other program's components, and external), including an advocacy and influence plan for strengthening the capacity of local systems and institutionsDesign tools and questions for USAID Nawiri teams to liaise with county officials and Ward Development Committees to ensure strategy is co-designed and relevant to context and scenario (failed rains, floods). Facilitate relationships with market actors (including government, other NGOs, private sector, and community partners) to revise plans and promote partner acceptance/buy-in.Upon request, support developing concept notes for shock-responsive economic interventions for USAID Nawiri to pivot as the context evolves.MENTORSHIP AND CAPACITY STRENGTHENING (25% of consultancy efforts)Provide training and on-going coaching to Resilient Livelihoods team members in resilient livelihoods foundations and MSD/poverty economics approaches.Provide guidance on applying market and economy driven-thinking and systems based approaches within and across sectors and other technical areas.Liaise with Resilience Advisors on Humanitarian - Development - Peacebuilding coherence, and Mercy Corps' resilience program practices to ensure the strategy targets critical resilience capacities.KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT AND LEARNING (5% of consultancy efforts)Under the lead of the Strategic Learning Lead, provide strategic input into the development of the USAID Nawiri Learning Agenda related to Resilient Livelihoods for Nutrition.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION AND SCOPE OF WORKProgram Description and PurposeProject objectives: The aim of the KPLAY project is to: Develop PlayLabs in KPLAY's area of work in Kilifi and Kwale County. KPLAY will work with teachers and county education officials to identify initial materials and methods for inclusion in an adaptable PlayLab model. PlayLabs are customized school-based spaces for playful interactions and creativity, containing context-appropriate lo-fi and high-tech LTPT resources that speak to girls and boys. Conducteducator professional development in Kwale and Kilifi County for primary school educators. KPLAY will work with Community Service Officers (CSOs) and local government education offices to introduce teachers to LTPT by engaging in play with students and play experts, then creating and testing PlayLabs and methods in workshops held at times that allow teachers to attend, and that do not take teachers out of class. Carryout coaching. Coaching will involve master facilitators who will lead teacher training and training of trainers in their areas of leadership. This will be done periodically in a systematic cycle to reinforce the values and benefits of LTPT. Trained coaches and Professional Learning Communities will provide ongoing teacher supportwith the skills gained from coaching.Sustainability of learning through play with technology and supporting the implementation of the competency-based curriculum (CBC). This will be done through coaching, school visit and observations and offering of support in the KPLAY PlayLabs that will ensure the soft skills are implemented successfully.Target population: The KPLAY Project will be implemented with teachers in grades 3-6 (grade levels aligned with the CBC's ICT focus) to build awareness of and skills in LTPT and apply it effectively in the classroom across Kilifi and Kwale Counties.KPLAY will build the capacity of 1400 teachers to experience learning through play and technology and will assist 600 school leaders, 200 teacher leaders, and 30 system-embedded coaches to support these teachers. Local partners will work with communities to support LTPT at home and in school. These efforts will equip at least 90,000 skills measured by Kenyan exams, and the creative, learning-to-learn, and collaborative skills the CBC has introduced.Project Outcomes: The KPLAY approach is embedded within national and county educational systems to equip teachers as LTPT experts and champions, and to create a Kenyan-owned LTPT scaling model for coastal Kenya. KPLAY works with educators to design curriculum-linked, age- and context-appropriate approaches, methods, and materials that scales Learning Through Play with Technology in our Kenyan classrooms. Our team works with education officials to create sustainability strategies in years 1 and 2. By year 3, the Kenyan-built and led strategy will be finalized and be in operation, laying the groundwork to continue LTPT after project completion.Key Components and Activities:The project activities are implemented through the following components: Component 1: Teacher Professional DevelopmentIn four years, KPLAY will reach teachers in 50% of the schools in Kilifi and Kwale Counties. KPLAY has piloted its approach in 11 diverse schools, then scale to reach 100 strategically selected schools per year in years 2-4. Every year, KPLAY will gather data on materials, methods, and approaches, and on introducing LTPT to teachers, school leaders, and others, to iterate and refine the project. It will take note of school contexts (rural vs. urban, level of tech, language group, religion), to understand their effect on LTPT uptake. KPLAY will emphasize impacts on student learning to support scale and uptake. Advocacy and communications strategies around positive impacts of LTPT will promote it in communities neighboring KPLAY schools, priming LTPT for scale within target counties. KPLAY staff trains the teacher leaders, Curriculum Support Officers in Kilifi, and Kwale Counties on the following concepts: introduction to play and technology, introduction to hand-on learning activities, introduction to coding and Scratch.The CSOs will conduct zonal teacher training sessions with their respective teacher cells.Component 2: PlayLab Development:PlayLabs are customized school-based spaces for playful interactions and creativity that support the K-PLAY program. PlayLabs are spaces that contain context-appropriate lo-fi and high-tech LTPT resources that speak to girls and boys. PlayLabs, whether indoors or outdoors, fixed or mobile, will be child-centered and have values of playfulness, experimentation, curiosity, collaboration, and connection to the community.KPLAY Project will develop PlayLabs in each target school to create a place for students to practice their application of ICT. In the ICT Play Lab, teachers will form small groups (five to 10) of girls to collaborate in teams and practice diverse concepts requiring CBC skills of collaboration and teamwork. The project will equip the ICT PlayLabs with materials for making and tinkering, a Play Station for building, and a Technology Station. The Play Station will be a central area of the floor, where students can sit and play with building blocks and other locally available materials. The technology station will be equipped with a laptop, tablets, and a Mi-Fi connection. Students will have access to Scratch for operating basic online and offline coding activities. Furthermore, there will be a collaboration table that allows students to carry out group STEM activities.
